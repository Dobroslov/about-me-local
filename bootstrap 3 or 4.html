        Merging a pull request

Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge.
In this article

In a pull request, you propose that changes you've made on a head branch should be merged into a base branch. By default, any pull request can be merged at any time, unless the head branch is in conflict with the base branch. However, there may be restrictions on when you can merge a pull request into a specific branch. For example, you may only be able to merge a pull request into the default branch if required status checks are passing. For more information, see "About protected branches."

You can configure a pull request to merge automatically when all merge requirements are met. For more information, see "Automatically merging a pull request."

If the pull request has merge conflicts, or if you'd like to test the changes before merging, you can check out the pull request locally and merge it using the command line.

You can't merge a draft pull request. For more information about draft pull requests, see "About pull requests."

You can have head branches automatically deleted after pull requests are merged in your repository. For more information, see "Managing the automatic deletion of branches."

If you decide you don't want the changes in a topic branch to be merged to the upstream branch, you can close the pull request without merging.
